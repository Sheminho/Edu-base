# Edu-base
Our project is to develop an educational program that uses `augmented reality` technology to teach children `Arabic` and `English` numbers and letters in a `three-dimensional` way using `Unity Engine`. The project aims to make the learning process fun and entertaining for children, as numbers and letters are presented in an innovative and attractive way, which increases their encouragement and continuation in learning.</br>
## Project Stages
The program includes many different stages, including
  * Teaching Arabic numbers & testing on it
  * Teaching Arabic letters & testing on it
  * Teaching English numbers & testing on it
  * Teaching English letters & testing on it</br></br>
In addition to learning the correct `pronunciation` and how to use numbers and letters in daily life. The stages are designed in a way that allows children to learn independently while providing them with the necessary help and guidance if they encounter difficulties.</br>

## `A`ugmented `R`eality in the Project
Using `Augmented reality` technology, realistic 3D models are created and shown in our real life, including colorful and attractive graphics. Children can interact with the graphics, sounds and movements in the environment, which helps them learn numbers and letters in a fun and exciting way.</br>

## Mini Exam
Learners can also take `tests` to assess their skills, where they can show their skills in Arabic and English alphabet, numbers and receive results in real time. Learners can also challenge themselves and re-test after a period of time to see how they have improved.</br>
This means that learners will be able to improve their alphabet and number skills in a fun and useful way using Augmented Reality technology.</br>

 > In general, our project aims to improve the learning process of children and encourage them to learn and continue in it, through the  use of modern and creative technology to provide educational content that keeps pace with the aspirations of children in the current era.</br>
